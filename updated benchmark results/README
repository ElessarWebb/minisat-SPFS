TODO: ADJUST READMES


This folder contains a summary of all benchmark results [summary.pdf], as well as a visualization of this result [plot.pdf].

More detailed results are given in the two subfolders. The subfolder [original benchmarks] contains the benchmarks already present in the SP(SAT) paper, but with much longer running time and also, with satisfiable instances included. Also, more information such as the number of symmetry propagations is now available. The subfolder [SAT11 benchmarks] contains problems of the SAT11 competition in which we detected symmetry, and which might be included in the final version of the paper.

All benchmarks used a 1000 second time limit to detect symmetry with Shatter, and a 5000 second time limit to solve the resulting problem.

In the visualization [plot.pdf], we sorted the results on runtime for every algorithm separately. This figure makes it clear that SP(SAT)+opt outperforms (or at least, performs comparable to) Shatter, the current state-of-the art symmetry breaking method. Given the fact that our method is a dynamic symmetry breaking approach, we believe these results show that SP(SAT) is a significant contribution.
