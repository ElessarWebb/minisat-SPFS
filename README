For running Minisat with SPFS enabled, see instructions at the end of this page.

Quick Install

- Decide where to install the files . The simplest approach is to use
  GNU standard locations and just set a "prefix" for the root install
  directory (reffered to as $PREFIX below). More control can be
  achieved by overriding other of the GNU standard install locations
  (includedir, bindir, etc). Configuring with just a prefix:

  > make config prefix=$PREFIX

- Compiling and installing:

  > make install

================================================================================
Configuration

- Multiple configuration steps can be joined into one call to "make
  config" by appending multiple variable assignments on the same line.

- The configuration is stored in the file "config.mk". Look here if
  you want to know what the current configuration looks like.

- To reset from defaults simply remove the "config.mk" file or call
  "make distclean".

- Recompilation can be done without the configuration step.

Run minisat with same heuristics as version 2.0:

> minisat <cnf-file> -no-luby -rinc=1.5 -phase-saving=0 -rnd-freq=0.02

Running Minisat with Symmetry Propagation For Sat (SPFS):

After running the Quick Install (see above), compile the core version of the 
solver using one of the following commands:

> make cd
> make cp
> make cr
> make csh

which compiles the Minisat core version with respectively debug, profile,
release or shared library options. SPFS is only implemented in the core version,
compiling any other version will not use symmetry breaking. Tests have been run
using the release option.

Next, run minisat with a given cnf-file:

> ./minisat_core <cnf-file>

The program will automatically check if a file with the name <cnf-file>.txt
is available at the same location as <cnf-file>. If this is the case, it will
extract symmetries from this file, which should be in the format as generated 
by Shatter (http://www.aloul.net/Tools/shatter).

Examples of cnf-files and their symmetries are present in the file 
cnf_testfiles_with_symmetry.zip on this repository.
