Quick Install

- Decide where to install the files . The simplest approach is to use
  GNU standard locations and just set a "prefix" for the root install
  directory (reffered to as $PREFIX below). More control can be
  achieved by overriding other of the GNU standard install locations
  (includedir, bindir, etc). Configuring with just a prefix:

  > make config prefix=$PREFIX

- Compiling and installing:

  > make install

================================================================================
Configuration

- Multiple configuration steps can be joined into one call to "make
  config" by appending multiple variable assignments on the same line.

- The configuration is stored in the file "config.mk". Look here if
  you want to know what the current configuration looks like.

- To reset from defaults simply remove the "config.mk" file or call
  "make distclean".

- Recompilation can be done without the configuration step.

Examples:

Run minisat with same heuristics as version 2.0:

> minisat <cnf-file> -no-luby -rinc=1.5 -phase-saving=0 -rnd-freq=0.02

Minisat with Symmetry Propagation (in SAT) - SP(SAT):

After running the Quick Install (see above), simply compile Minisat the normal
way. For the tests, we used the following command:

> make cr

which compiles the Minisat release version without the simplification extension.

Next, run minisat with a given cnf-file:

> ./minisat_core <cnf-file>

The SP(SAT)-code will automatically check whether a file with the name 
<cnf-file>.txt is available at the same location as <cnf-file>. If this is the 
case, it will extract symmetries from this file, which should be in the format 
as generated by Shatter (http://www.aloul.net/Tools/shatter).

The folder "cnf test files" contains the .cnf test files used for benchmarking
the Minisat+SP(SAT) code.

The folder "detailed experimental results" contains detailed test results in 
both .pdf as well as .ods format.

The file "Symmetry Propagation (in SAT).pdf" is a paper submitted to the 
SAT2012 conference, which describes the ideas and algorithms implemented in the
modified Minisat code presented here.
